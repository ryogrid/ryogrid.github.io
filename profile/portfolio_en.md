### Developed software (private development and university research activities)
#### [Development of NostrP2P, a pure P2P distributed microblogging system that allows machines inside NAT to participate](https://github.com/ryogrid/nostrp2p) 2024-Present
The system design of existing distributed microblogs (SNS), which consists of a relatively small number of servers, forces server operators to bear the burden of money and operational work in the form of volunteers. Considering that this may become an issue for system continuity, we are considering a design that allows all users to operate the server relatively easily, and that works together as one microblog. I implemented it. The implementation languages ​​are Go language (server) and dart language (client).  
　When using it as a microblog, you access the server you set up with a client implemented in the form of a browser app or native app. In this respect, the design includes a server-client configuration. Communicate with the server using REST I/F. It uses a protocol that is roughly the same as the [Nostr protocol](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips)　except that the servers cooperate on an overlay network, and the communication between the server and client is REST rather than Websocket . The reason why the system is named NostrP2P is because, broadly speaking, NostrP2P is like a distributed relay server in Nostr in a single image. The reason for the design being based on the Nostr protocol is that it is relatively easy to implement, the Nostr ecosystem can be used, and we thought it might be interesting to work with a system based on the Nostr protocol. be. For client development, we adopted Flutter (dart as the language). The implementation was done by forking the Nostr client [uchijo/flustr](https://github.com/uchijo/flustr) , rewriting it for NostrP2P, and enhancing it. Thanks to uchijo, the developer of flustr.  
　In NostrP2P, it is necessary to build a NAT-transparent overlay network so that machines inside the NAT can participate, but this uses [weaveworks/mesh](https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh) and does not use [ryogrid/gossip-overlay](https://github.com/ryogrid/gossip-overlay), a wrapper that I developed myself.  
　This is because we have determined that in NostrP2P, due to the characteristics of the application, it is acceptable for some messages to be lost or the order of arrival to be changed, and there is no need to adopt connection-based communication using gossip-overlay, which involves a considerable amount of overhead. be.

#### [Development of gossip-overlay, a library for building a NAT-transparent overlay network based on gossip protocol](https://github.com/ryogrid/gossip-overlay) 2023-Present
We wanted to be able to build an overlay network that machines inside NAT can also participate in, so we developed a library based on the gossip protocol. The implementation language is Go language.  
　Originally, the above was achieved by using [weaveworks/mesh](https://github.com/weaveworks/mesh) , but when looking at the overlay layer, the communication there is like UDP, and the transmitted data does not reach (the loss rate is Although the cost was not expected to be very high, it was not guaranteed and the ordering was not guaranteed. Also, when I tried to use it, there was a lack of documentation, so I had to read the implementation and find out how to use it.  
　Therefore, gossip-overlay is an implementation that provides a reliable connection-based server-client I/F on top of mesh overlay messaging, similar to TCP for IP. The I/F is also organized so that it can be used intuitively.  
　The SCTP protocol was adopted to build a reliable communication path, and the pion/sctp library was used to implement it. We implemented [gossip-port-forward](https://github.com/ryogrid/gossip-port-forward), a port forwarding tool, and distributed KVS gord-overlay, which operates on the overlay, as applications that also serve as tests for gossip-overlay . Both are implemented by incorporating gossip-overlay into existing software. We would like to thank the two developers of the original software. We would also like to thank the mesh developers.

#### [Development of SamehadaDB, a simple relational database (RDB)](https://github.com/ryogrid/SamehadaDB) 2021-present
After developing a distributed KVS, I became interested in the internal design and implementation of more widely used RDBs and decided to develop one myself.  
　Since a zero-based implementation would be difficult, I am developing my own implementation based on [BusTub](<https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub>), which is available as an educational implementation in the open courseware lectures at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The original implementation is in C++.  
　The original implementation was done in C++, but Go was chosen for the implementation because we wanted to implement it in a more modern language.  
　The porting of C++ to Go was done to some extent by the project [go-bustub](<https://github.com/brunocalza/go-bustub>), so the code is directly based on that project.  
　It was originally a private project, but because he felt he could not work alone, he recruited co-developers, and now two people including himself are working on the project.

#### [Rust implementation of FunnelKVS, a DHT-based distributed KVS](https://github.com/ryogrid/FunnelKVS/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md) 2020-present
　A distributed KVS (access interface is REST) was implemented as a subject for Rust language learning.  
　First, a simple simulator was developed in Python to verify whether the design (recognition) based on the Chord algorithm (protocol) adopted as the node lookup mechanism was correct before implementing the real system.  
　The simulator was then ported to the Rust language.  
　The reason for implementing both the simulator and the Rust language was that the simulator itself was designed so that internal method calls could be replaced with RPC calls, so that the simulator could be generally implemented in the real system. Finally, the method invocation part was replaced with RPC and a few other modifications were made to make the simulator work as a distributed KVS that operates with multiple processes. The performance was slow, taking about 30 ms even for a get query of small data in an environment with 20 nodes running on a single machine, probably because the inter-node communication was also implemented using REST. 
Howerver, we were able to confirm that at least 20 nodes can scale the overall throughput when querying multiple nodes in parallel.  
　The put data is designed to keep replicas on multiple nodes, and even if, for example, 5 out of 20 nodes are randomly selected to be taken down, the system will continue to operate normally and no data will be lost.  
　The data consistency is designed to provide generally strong consistency, but we believe that there may be cases where even result consistency cannot be guaranteed depending on access patterns.  
　The development work was done during the time allowed for research and development at the Oly Research Institute, where I work.

#### [Development of FX Trade Agents Learned by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)](https://qiita.com/ryo_grid/items/1552d70eb2a8c15f6fd2) 2020
　As an example of applying deep learning to time series data, we created a model of a deep reinforcement learning (DQN) trading agent and tried to simulate automated FX trading.  
　As a result, we believe that we have developed a model (and its selection method) that may be of some practical use, but we have not yet verified the practicality of the model by using the agent we developed.

#### [Attempts to Communicate Intention with a Consumer EEG Sensing Headset](https://qiita.com/ryo_grid/items/6e6028b02004455a48ff) 2020
　I attempted to see if brain wave headset (about 20,000 yen) at the level of consumer products could be used for intention communication, referring to papers as appropriate.  
　As a result, we failed to realize the form described in the papers we referred to, but we concluded that it was not impossible.  
　The development work was also done during the time allowed for research and development at the Oly Research Institute, where I work.

#### [Over-Nat-Lib: tool and library that allows P2P communication between PCs in different NATs to transfer files and connect pipes](https://qiita.com/ryo_grid/items/651486649f116700) 2019
　The aiortc library is used to establish a P2P SCTP communication channel after UDP hole-punching and over-NAT (using aiortc's WebRTC data channel establishment functionality).  
　Python was used for the implementation.  
　The communication channel is established and maintained by starting the included server locally, which is distributed as a pip module (onatlib), and the communication channel can be used for file and pipe transfers using the included tools.  
　In addition, the locally started server can listen to any port for communication, and socket communication can be performed on the established communication channel, even with tools other than those included in the package.  
　In order for two parties in different NATs to communicate in WebRTC, a signaling server and a STUN server are needed to mediate information between the two parties, but the former is hosted on its own server and the latter is provided by Google (hard-coded in aiortc).  
　Although it is mainly a tool for what it calls a library, it also provides a utility library for python to simplify communication with the other side using a local server.  
　Using this library, socket communication is possible without being aware of the existence of a local server.  
　For Windows platforms, the library is also available in a github repository packaged as an exe file for use without the Python environment (see the release page).  
　The development work was also done during the time allowed for research and development at the Oly Research Institute, where I work.

#### [Running a sample program for file transfer (P2P direct communication) over the data channel of aiortc, a Python WebRTC library](https://qiita.com/ryo_grid/items/74d2310aab3ed4f60584) 2019
　Establish SCTP communication channel via P2P after exceeding NAT by UDP hole punching.  
　We are currently designing and starting to implement a data transfer (file and pipe) program using aiortc.  
　We will host our own shared signaling server, and users will be able to transfer files over NAT and data over pipes (think of netcat) without the need for a Python environment, just by using the client software we distribute.

#### [Developing an Android remote desktop app for Windows operation with very low bandwidth that won't kill your packet even on a mobile connection](https://github.com/ryogrid/RemoteDesktopOneWindowForNovelGrame) 2018-present
　For specific applications, the FPS should be extremely low (about 1 FPS) and the voice quality should also be reduced to reduce data traffic, but we have not found any software that meets those requirements, so we are developing this software.  
　Both the server and Android application are developed in C#, with the Android side using the Xamarin framework.  
　There was almost no information on live encoding/decoding of media data on the Internet, and we struggled with the implementation, and we were able to compress continuous images using H264 (useful for low FPS image delivery as it allows differential compression) and audio compression using Opus (we first tried to implement it using AAC, but the processing latency was too large, so we decided to use Opus for the live encoding/decoding). (We first tried an AAC implementation, but the processing latency was too large to be useful for live delivery).  
　The amount of communication varies greatly depending on the difference in images (e.g., if there is no change in the contents of the PC screen display, the amount transferred will be very small), but the audio is about 400 Byte/s, and the images (on a PC with a resolution of 1920x1080 and a screen capture transferred at 1 FPS) vary from almost zero to about 160 KByte/s, and the image data was able to drop from almost zero to a fluctuating level of about 160 KByte/s.  
　Note that the maximum image data is the maximum when everything is rewritten, so we believe that 40 KByte/s on average would be sufficient for a novel game or other game play.  
　Mouse operation by tapping, long tapping, and dragging from the smartphone application side has already been implemented.  
　The development work was also done during the time allowed for research and development at the Oly Research Institute, where I work.  
　The following is a technical article I wrote to share my know-how.

#### [Recognizing facial expressions with a webcam and moving a character in a browser app with Websocket](https://qiita.com/ryo_grid/items/29425eb80bae1049322d) 2018
　I wanted to make it work with a web app running locally, so I tailored a Python facial recognition program as a WebSocket server, using existing code as a reference, and moved a Live2D bishojo character in the web app using facial recognition.  
　I also created a similar face recognition WebSocket server as a Unity application.  
　The development work was done during the time allowed for research and development at the Oly Research Institute, where I work.

　Developed the basic software to realize Sensing Web, a concept that aims to create a web environment using open sensor data. The user can remotely place a program for data processing in the vicinity of the sensor (privacy information is removed in the vicinity of the sensor and transferred to the user). ptrace-based system call emulation is used to realize a sandbox configuration and virtual devices.  

#### [D-Cloud](http://ryogrid.net/~ryo/dist/kanbayashi_master_thesis.pdf) 2009
　A large-scale test farm, D-Cloud, was developed; D-Cloud is based on Eucalyptus, an open source cloud building software. Users can test large-scale distributed systems without being bothered by their complexity, thanks to the automation of test environment construction and verification tasks and large-scale computing resources provided by D-Cloud. D-Cloud accelerates the testing process in software development. To support system construction and test execution in software testing of distributed systems, D-Cloud provides a means to define and execute tests intuitively and flexibly by using a description format that combines XML description and the Ruby language, which allows flexible description of behavior (= automatic test environment construction tool in a cloud environment, test scenario execution tool in a distributed environment). test scenario execution tools in a distributed environment.
